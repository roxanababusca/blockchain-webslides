# Blockchain and web3 webslides

I created this project with the goal of delivering an engaging presentation, an alternative to Google Slides, Power Point and other known options. After experimenting with different frameworks I stopped at [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) as I found it easy-to-customize to fit my desired aesthetics and presentation structure.

I've used Vite.js to build the project and Vercel to deploy it.
